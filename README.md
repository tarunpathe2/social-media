I have deleted the older project for social media application and created the new one as Im not getting the expected output. In this project I have created the user and Post model and then established the relationship between them and now Im able to create the multiple user and fetch them and delete as well, also Im able to create multiple post for certain user, fetch them, update them and delete them.
